## 📌 Overview

This application extracts, processes, and analyzes financial data from **SEC 10-K filings** to provide intelligent insights and responses through a structured pipeline:

- 📄 Extract text from PDF documents  
- 🧠 Convert unstructured text to structured JSON using **Google Gemini** with few-shot prompting  
- 🔍 Create semantic embeddings with **Sentence Transformers**  
- 🗂 Store embeddings in **ChromaDB** (a vector database)  
- 🔁 Implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline  
- ✍️ Generate structured and controlled responses via **LLM prompting**  

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Extraction**: Pulls raw text directly from 10-K PDF filings  
- **Structured Data Conversion**: Converts unstructured text into a structured JSON format using few-shot prompts  
- **Semantic Search**: Uses Sentence Transformers to enable intelligent querying and context-aware retrieval  
- **RAG Pipeline**: Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for contextual, relevant responses  
- **Controlled Generation**: Ensures responses are structured, consistent, and relevant through prompt engineering
